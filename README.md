# TweetYourArchive

This will let you set up a bot that tweets your twitter archive, on a delay.

# Adding your tweets

Get your Twitter archive .zip file from Twitter, unzip it, and put the contents of the "data/js" directory in the `tweets` directory here. So that directory should look something like:

```
payload_details.js
tweet_index.js
tweets/
user_details.js
```

The `tweets` folder should contain a bunch of .js files.
